pyrsig Example Gallery
======================

This gallery houses examples on how to use pyrsig to do various
analyses. This includes downloading and visualizing the data.

Some examples require some features of pyrsig that are not required
for minimal functionality. To install all the necessary libaries
for any example, run the command below (use --user if not an admin):

```bash
python -m pip install --user pyrsig pycno pyproj netcdf4
```

In notebooks (e.g., on Google Colab), this can be done live with
the command below (may require kernel restart):

```python
%pip install --user pyrsig pycno pyproj netcdf4
```

To run an example in a notebook:

1. Copy the command above into a new cell and run it.
2. Copy the code from the example into a new cell and run it.
